# Assignments-2
This project is based on the sustainable development goal of the united nation to inform about goal number 14. This goal is about to conservation and sustainable use of the oceans, seas, and marine resources for sustainable development.

We have decided to present these issues through a parallax scrolly telling with the use of animation.
This project is useful to inform people about the issue on a platform that is interestingly used by many people.

To get started with the project you can look at the Figma sketch: https://www.figma.com/file/l0dvhjg02OfrQQgOVcaXLb/Assignment-2---Animation-Prototype?node-id=0%3A1.
