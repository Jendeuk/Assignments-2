# Assignments-2
This project is based on the sustainable development goal of the united nation to inform about goal number 14. This goal is about to conservation and sustainable use of the oceans, seas, and marine resources for sustainable development.

We have decided to present these issues through a parallax scrolly telling with the use of animation. 
This project is useful because it informs and educates about the problem that is below seas and build empathy to the sea life that many people doesn’t think about. Such like plastic/marine solution, fishery collapse, ocean warming, acidification and eutrophication.

To get started with the project you can look at the Figma sketch: https://www.figma.com/file/l0dvhjg02OfrQQgOVcaXLb/Assignment-2---Animation-Prototype?node-id=0%3A1.
